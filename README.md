# THM-Penetration-Tester-Path
This repository documents my journey through the TryHackMe's Penetration Tester Roadmap, featuring structured writeups, attack methodologies, tool usage, and key security concepts across offensive security fundamentals.

I organized this Repo to help me track my learning consistency in path.

## 🧨 THM Junior Penetration Tester Status: COMPLETED TryHackMe Path

Completed the **TryHackMe Junior Penetration Tester Path**, building a solid foundation in offensive security by simulating real-world attack scenarios across networks, web applications, and operating systems. This path focuses on **thinking like an attacker**, understanding how systems fail, and exploiting weaknesses safely and methodically.

### 🔓 Core Competencies

* **Reconnaissance & Enumeration**

  * Perform passive and active reconnaissance against target systems
  * Enumerate services, users, shares, and misconfigurations
  * Identify attack surfaces using scanning and manual techniques

* **Vulnerability Discovery**

  * Detect common vulnerabilities such as weak authentication, misconfigurations, and outdated services
  * Identify web application flaws including **IDOR, file inclusion, command injection, and XSS**
  * Assess risk and exploitability within defined scopes

* **Exploitation Techniques**

  * Exploit vulnerable services and web applications to gain initial access
  * Perform local privilege escalation on Linux and Windows systems
  * Use public exploits responsibly and modify them when necessary

* **Post-Exploitation**

  * Maintain access and pivot within compromised environments
  * Extract credentials and sensitive data
  * Demonstrate impact while respecting engagement boundaries

* **Reporting & Methodology**

  * Follow structured penetration testing methodologies
  * Clearly document findings, exploitation steps, and impact
  * Provide actionable remediation recommendations

### 🧠 Tester Mindset

* Thinks offensively while respecting rules of engagement
* Curious, methodical, and persistent during exploitation
* Balances automation with manual testing
* Focuses on **impact**, not just vulnerability counts

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Nmap, Gobuster, Hydra
* Metasploit Framework
* Burp Suite
* Linux & Windows privilege escalation techniques
* Basic scripting for automation

### 📌 Outcome

This path prepared me for entry-level **Penetration Tester / Red Team** roles by developing practical skills in reconnaissance, exploitation, and reporting, with a strong emphasis on real-world attack chains rather than isolated vulnerabilities.
