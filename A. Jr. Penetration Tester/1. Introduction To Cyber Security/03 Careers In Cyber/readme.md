#  Careers In Cyber
In this room, I gained understanding of different Careers in Cyber Security both in the offensive and defensive Security.

---

### Security Analyst

- Responsible for maintaining the security of an organizations data and are integral to constructing security measures cross organizations  to protect them from attacks.
- They  explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventive measures.
- Work with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.
- Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response.
- Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.


### Security Engineer

- Develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data sourced from different members of the security workforce. 
- Work across circumventing a breadth of attacks, including web application attacks, network threats, and evolving trends and tactics. 
- Responsible for testing and screening security measures across software, monitoring networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities and identifying/implementing systems needed for optimal security

The ultimate goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.

To rise as a **Security Engineer** build technical and Hands-on experience in SOC, Penetration Testing: both offensive and defensive Security.

### Incident Responder

- Respond productively and efficiently to security breaches.
- Develops and adopts a thorough, actionable incident response plans, policies and protocols to enact during and following incidents.
- Maintains strong security best practices and supports incident response measures
- Does Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

Incident response metrics include **MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR** - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover (from attacks.) 

The aim is to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications.


### Digital Forensics Examiner

- Collects digital evidence while observing legal procedures
- Analyses digital evidence to find answers related to the case
- Documents findings and report on the case.
  
### Malware Analyst

- Have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language. 
- Carries out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
- Conducts dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
- Documents and reports all the findings.

Sometimes called a **reverse-engineer** as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language.

The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

### Penetration Tester

- Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
- Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
- Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention
  
### Red Teamer

Share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. 

- Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
- Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
- Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances


Penetration testers **look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing,** whilst **red teamers** are **enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities.** 
This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. 

Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company. They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place.
