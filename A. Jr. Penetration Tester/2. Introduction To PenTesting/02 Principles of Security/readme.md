# Principles of Security

This THM Room is not Free, Rather it's a Premium one.

Thus I have documented deeper details of the Learning in a private Repo.

The room Helped me understand the principles of Information Security that secures data and protects systems from abuse.

## MY TakeHomes From the Room

There are guiding principles of information security and frameworks used to protect data and systems to the elements of what exactly makes data secure.

**Defence in Depth** is the use of multiple varied layers of security to an organisation's systems and data in the hopes that multiple layers will provide redundancy in an organisation's security perimeter.

The **CIA triad model** should help determine the value of data that it applies to, and in turn, the attention it needs from the business. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Principles of privileges:**

It is vital to administrate and correctly define the various levels of access to an information technology system individuals require. 
The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:

- The individual's role/function within the organisation
- The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals: Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM).

**Some popular and effective security models** used to achieve the three elements of the CIA triad:

- **The Bell-La Padula Model**: used to achieve confidentiality. "no write down, no read up", "can't read up, can read down".

- **The Biba Model**: arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of the CIA triad. "no write up, no read down", "can read up, can't read down".

**Threat modelling**

The process of **reviewing, improving,** and **testing** the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services. A critical stage in this, is identifying likely threats that an application or system may face, the vulnerabilities a system or application may be vulnerable to.

The process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. It is, however, a complex process that needs constant review and discussion with a dedicated team. The principles all return to:
- Preparation
- Identification
- Mitigations
- Review


An effective threat model includes:

- Threat intelligence
- Asset identification
- Mitigation capabilities
- Risk assessment


**STRIDE Framework to effective threat modellling:**

STRIDE (Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation threats, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of privileges) and PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis.

**Incident Response**:

Incident is a breach of security. Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact.

Through a good incident response plan, Incidents should be solved.

**Six phases of Incident Response**
