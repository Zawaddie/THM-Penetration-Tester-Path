# Walking an Application

This Room is not Free, Rather it's a Premium one.

Thus I have documented the Learning in a private Repo.

In the room, I reviewed a web application for security issues using only my Web Browsers Developer tools.

I basically learnt hacking with just a browser and no other tools nor scripts.
